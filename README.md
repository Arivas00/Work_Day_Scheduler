# Work Day Scheduler

## Developer Notes

A a developer I was tasked with creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The application uses the library Moment.js to track dates and times.


## Criteria

```

When the application is opened.
The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
WHEN scrolling down.
The user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
WHEN the user views the time blocks for that day.
Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (grey), present (red), or future (green).
WHEN the user clicks into a time block.
THEN the user can enter an event in the time block.
WHEN the user clicks the save button for that time block.
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage.
WHEN the page is refreshed.
THEN the saved events remain.
```


## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
